But while it’s not as glamorous as inventing an Uber or a Spotify, recycling that waste can be a gold mine.  <br />
Egyptian entrepreneur Essam Hashem saw his chance and, in 2006, jumped on it. He founded Spear Ink when he realized no one in the Middle East was interested in one extremely ordinary, but wide open, e-waste opportunity: used printer cartridges.<br />

Today, Spear Ink is one of the biggest e-waste recyclers in the Middle East and operates on a franchise model providing the machines and training on how to to refill cartridges. The head office is now in Dubai but it maintains a factory in Alexandria to build the machines themselves and to remanufacture old and damaged cartridges.<br />
Hashem is now planning to launch a new franchise business for general e-waste, and says the new technology will be a first in the MENA region.<br />
He says it takes about a gallon of oil to make one new laser printer cartridge, and every remanufactured cartridge saves about 1.1 kg of metal and plastic waste from heading for landfills.<br />
“The real treasure, which is more than any income, is the enjoyment of turning trash into something useful,” Hashem says.<br />

Wamda: Why did you start Spear Ink?<br />
Essam Hashem: In 2005, when I worked at an IT maintenance center, I was dealing with many companies in Egypt which consumed a lot of printer cartridges. I wondered why they sent that 'big treasure' of aluminum, plastics, and microchips to the landfill every year - even if there is no recycling option, at least they can reuse.<br />
There were many small refill shops but large companies didn't want to risk low printing quality or using toxic components, due to the bad reputation of those stores. Meanwhile, big banks or any entity that has a yearly purchase strategy preferred the packed and guaranteed product.<br />
Our main job is recycling empty cartridges, refurbishing and remanufacturing new cartridges, and our aim is to do this environmentally, safely and at a high quality. We collect the old cartridges, remanufacture the ones that are damaged, and we segregate and classify the parts into plastics and metals.   <br />
I opened my first warehouse in Alexandria in 2006, and began franchising the technology in Egypt and Syria.<br />
Wamda: How have you convinced businesses to try Spear Ink?<br />
Hashem: My business is based on cultural change around waste disposal, so I needed to put a lot of effort into awareness campaigns and waste collection campaigns.<br />

For example, we have the Green Sharm and Green Aswan initiatives for electronic waste collection, collaborating with the governorate and Ministry of Environment. It was a kind of corporate social responsibility, to raise the awareness about hazardous e-waste, and to each governmental organizations and NGOs how to eliminate it.<br />
Wamda: As taking care of the environment is clearly an important part of Spear Ink, are you able to measure how much of an environmental impact you're having?<br />
Hashem: Our monthly average refilling rate is 4,000 cartridges. Yearly this saves approximately<br />
• 15 tons of plastic<br />
• 2.5 tons of aluminum             <br />
• 2.5 tons of toner powder<br />
• 5 tons of rubber and metals      <br />
• 4.5 tons of polyurethane and metals<br />
The carbon footprint of a remanufactured cartridge is approximately 2.8 kg, which means we save 134,400 kg of CO2 emissions every year.<br />
The clean technology also protects laborers' health unlike the traditional method of 'drill and fill’: a hole is drilled into the old cartridge, the new powder added and the hole sealed, exposing the refiller to breathing in harmful toner powder.<br />
Wamda: Can you explain Spear Ink’s technology?<br />
Hashem: I did many trials to achieve a high standard of cartridge remanufacturing to avoid toxic dust and other bad environmental effects. Unfortunately, there was no Egyptian industry standard so instead I used the American American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) benchmark for refilled cartridges.<br />
<br />
I took one year to research and design the first refill machine, but it was too low-tech with a semiautomatic process and some manual operation. But the first prototype was very simple so when I finished with few mistakes I was really confident it could work.   <br />
Our latest technology now lets you do everything through a touch screen. We import micro-electronics systems from Siemens and the machines include a cartridge circuit tester.<br />
For the last five years we’ve worked hard to design and plan a production line to include all electronic waste, including precious metals. This will be the first Arabian machinery for metal recovery from e-waste.<br />

Wamda: What have been the biggest obstacles?<br />
Hashem: The main challenges were in the last four years. By end of 2010 I had three branches, two in Egypt and one in Syria, so the revolutions there stopped me from being able to export from those centers.<br />
In Egypt, it was one of my dreams to see a political change as I experienced the real face of the bureaucracy’s effect on business. On the first day of the revolution I was happy as I thought my industry would start to build, but now I think the Egyptian revolution has been against me, not against Mubarak.<br />
The worst effect was because of the security situation.<br />
We started out trained franchisers at our site in Alexandria, but although we began to do training at clients’ sites it wasn’t enough. All people were too afraid to visit Egypt or deal with companies from Egypt, and for final products that was no market for exports too.<br />
So we did as much as we could in the local market. It was very hard as traders here to use installment payments, making things difficult for us financially. But gradually we started to make some deals with nearby markets such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan, which understand the Egyptian situation.<br />

Before the revolution, the main problem was competition with illegal brokers. They would make counterfeit cartridges so were able to pay more for collection and sell fake products for higher prices. Our solution was through awareness to build a culture with a commitment for society. We pay three Egyptian pounds ($0.38) per used cartridge.<br />
It wasn’t one hundred percent successful but it was enough, given our smaller scale at the time.<br />
Wamda: What are your plans for the future?<br />
Hashem: Our Spear Ink brand has expanded quickly outside Egypt and through Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon by selling franchises. Now we are developing a production line for precious metal recovery from e-waste, and will launch a new franchise business this year in Dubai called “Dr. WEEE.”  <br />
WEEE stands for Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, and it will recycle electronics as well as cartridge remanufacturing in the United Arab Emirates. The franchise will include classification and dismantling of electronics, with some processing such as shredding and hard drive crushing.<br />
We’re exporting to 15 countries in Africa and the MENA region such as Morocco, Ghana and Uganda, and now we want to target the Indian and Pakistani markets as well. For those we’re still in the marketing and planning stage.<br />

The Middle East is at an inflection point as more and more shoppers buy online via social media platforms and mobile devices, yet merchants don’t have the options to properly handle them.<br />
According to Smart Insights, mobile traffic is driving more than 20 percent of internet purchases in the MENA region, thanks to smartphone penetration of 89 percent and social media penetration of 27 percent.<br />
But SME merchants in Asian and MENA emerging markets suffer from a lack of epayment solutions tailored to serve their needs. Many markets require online merchants to place deposits from $5000 to $50,000 before they even make their first online transaction.<br />
This is what pushed Sirish Kumar to co-found Telr, a payment gateway that allows merchants to accept and manage online payments via web, mobile and, crucially, social media.<br />
After holding leadership positions in Motorola, Nokia, Cargill and most recently at PayPal as CFO for Southeast Asia, Kumar is now CEO of Telr, and providing a way for SME merchants to deal with multiple currencies from buyers and draw cash in their own currency.<br />
Wamda: What are you doing to make merchants’ lives easier?<br />
Sirish Kumar: We are focused on raising awareness on the benefits of going online, especially for SME merchants and entrepreneurs. Merchants don’t need to have websites to sell online anymore, with platforms like Facebook and Instagram making it easier than ever to engage in ecommerce. We are one of the few payment companies in the world that have a Payment Card Industry Level 1 compliance certification. Additionally, our merchants can transact in local currency directly (without any intermediary FX processes). This is a big relief to merchants from any size.<br />
<br />
Partnerships in this ecosystem are not to be taken lightly, especially with banks. <br />
<br />
Wamda: What is the value behind your latest partnership with the Arab Bank?<br />
Kumar: As per this partnership, we are now responsible for onboarding merchants on to Arab Bank’s emerchants programme. That includes due-diligence, integration and ongoing support and risk management. What this means is:<br />
·   One of the most established and trusted banks in the region is now an integral part of this ecosystem. We believe competition is good, and providing merchants with more choices will only stimulate the ecommerce economy and push us all to innovate.<br />
·   We are now able to cut the standard onboarding time (9 – 15 weeks) by 90 percent - meaning entrepreneurs, startups and SMEs don’t need to be stuck in paperwork limbo.<br />
·   Waiving the ridiculously high security deposits charged by some banks for e-merchants (between $5,000 – $50,000, and that’s before they even make their first transaction). This is especially important for startups and SMEs who need access to as much cashflow as possible. This will allow them to focus resources on developing their product and user experience instead of having to put valuable funds away.<br />
·   A flexible and competitive fees structure that is among the lowest in the region<br />
<br />
In this particular region, we have a responsibility to build an environment that encourages innovative startups and existing companies to go online and become part of the booming ecommerce sector, but many found it challenging with all the restrictions and red tape surrounding the process of launching an e-business.<br />
<br />
Wamda: What efforts have you made to work around or lobby to change the bank regulations in this region?<br />
Kumar: We want to work in close coordination with regulators, banks, web-store builders… We will waive upfront costs that merchants had to pay to banks before their first online transaction, and we will roll out simple pricing and every merchant will be given access to all the features and facilities they need to grow their business. We are committed to reducing the onboarding time for merchants from 15 weeks to less than two weeks in the coming months.<br />
Wamda: Are you considering launching operations with ceilings on transaction size or withdrawals to work around central banks’ regulations and AML (anti money laundering) laws in the region? <br />
Kumar: We have been working with banks and providers such as MasterCard and Visa to enable merchants to onboard faster without compromising on AML and other card rules. We are committed to explore all such options that enable merchants to start their online business within the compliance framework of local, regional and global regulations or scheme regulations.<br />
Wamda: Based on your experience with PayPal, and now with Telr, where do you think the biggest efforts should be invested to have the region open up more to online payments? Can you site three bottlenecks?<br />
Kumar: Higher growth of local ecommerce can only happen once more entrepreneurs sell online.<br />
Merchants usually have to suffer up to 15 weeks of waiting to get onboarded to start their first online transaction. They have to place security deposits, pay set up fees and other upfront costs before they have sold a single product. For the Middle East to grow at 40 percent year-on-year by 2020, we would need payment solutions like ours to provide one stop solutions for web store development, logistics and analytics. This will help merchants focus on their business. We would like debit cards to be e-enabled. Countries like India saw a huge growth once debit cards and online banking were e-enabled for buyers to use the same as a funding source.<br />
Wamda: What are your thoughts on cash on delivery (COD)? Can it be playing more of a positive role than a negative one to help raise awareness around ecommerce?<br />
Kumar: COD forms a major part of completing transactions that originated on merchants’ website or social media platform such as Facebook. Cash continues to be the ecosystem’s biggest competitor. However regulators and banks are positively changing direction in the MENA region with entities like SADAD in KSA making a great push to encourage online business by offering online banking as a funding source to buyers.<br />
Wamda: What are three tips you give young entrepreneurs looking to launch an online store?<br />
·  Kumar: Choose the right partners. I cannot stress this enough. Banks, logistics and payment partners can grow or stifle your business. Take as much time as you need to match your needs with what is on offer and make sure to choose partners that can meet or exceed these needs.<br />
<br />
We all want to work with the biggest names possible, but that’s not necessarily the best option for you.<br />
<br />
·   Don’t be afraid to experiment and fail. You have all the tools and facilities to kick start your online business. The internet provides you with countless opportunities, accessing consumers across many countries and reducing incremental costs for incremental revenues to your business. Consumer habits are changing and trust for doing business online is on the rise.<br />
<br />
So do not worry to go online. If you look at some of world’s biggest online businesses, they were built on previous ventures that have failed or had to evolve to remain in business.<br />
<br />
Netflix comes to mind. What these guys have done was phenomenal. Looking back, I remember a time where they were ridiculed for their DVD rental model, but they’ve successfully turned that around and are now an entertainment juggernaut.<br />
·   Be super passionate about your vision. Get smarter people in your team and you will see the multiplier effect it has on your execution capabilities.<br />

There is no shortage of literature about failure. Bloomberg reported that the average startup that failed between 2010 and 2013 failed 20 months after its last financing round.<br />
Indeed, 90 percent of all startups will eventually fail, according to Forbes.<br />
Entrepreneurs can wax poetic about their failures. Take FailCon, a convention where entrepreneurs try to learn from their failures before they move on to their next - and hopefully wildly successful - venture.<br />
And there is speculation that we’re in a startup bubble, that funds are flowing into businesses that are unlikely to provide returns.<br />
So how can entrepreneurs prepare for, and learn from, the seemingly inevitable?<br />
Wamda discussed just this with entrepreneur, investor and Kamelizer CEO Hanan Abdel Meguid.<br />
“Failure is the most frequent milestone you’ll encounter,” she noted.<br />

There are arrogant misperceptions on investor interest and plastic stereotypes about customer bases, uninformed judgments about legalities, and plenty more puzzling ideas around what is actually happening that blur the reality that is the Saudi startup ecosystem. <br />
We can all agree that entrepreneurship, both as a culture and a mindset, is slowly but surely growing in the Kingdom. However, one must also realize that a country with a landmass ironically roughly the same size as Greenland is home to many varying yet thriving mini-ecosystems stretching from coast to coast.<br />
As it came up in one discussion, most risk takers are in the West, the techies are in the East and all the money is in the middle.<br />
The faces of Saudi Arabia's entrepreneurial future. (Image via the BBC)<br />
Today’s piece is not about the state of the ecosystem in Saudi Arabia for an international audience - I’ll be talking about that later in other posts. Instead, part one of Misreading Saudi Entrepreneurship will be about the untapped potential of 'wantrepreneurs' and more specifically a message to women hesitant to take the leap of faith. The willingness is there, but the resistance to risk taking is strong. The value from failure is misunderstood, and the overwhelming cultural deterrents are all too real. Job security, family business, fast income, complacency, reputation, social expectations and family conditions.  <br />
As an active contributor to the Kingdom's startup ecosystem, I increasingly get to meet more women wanting to become entrepreneurs than men. You can see their growing determination, solid work ethic, boundless curiosity and graceful optimism towards collaboration and suddenly, in more ways than one, they seem to be the most qualified change agents for actually getting things done!<br />
In other words, I see an entrepreneurial future in Saudi Arabia that is female.<br />
The entrepreneurship space in Saudi Arabia is one in which I believe women can not only excel, but also play substantially greater leadership roles than their male counterparts. As such, here are my top reasons for why I believe more women in Saudi Arabia should explore their entrepreneurial ambitions further.<br />
The gender inequality issue is no secret: We witness it everyday. It’s not fair and it’s not going to change overnight. As an entrepreneur however, she is seen as an equal for her ideas, her skills and her unwavering ability to make her idea a reality. Investors care about her mindset and attitude and not so much about her gender. Interestingly enough, they actually prefer seeing more successful women lately.<br />
Limited choice in academic and job variety: The list of what women can and can't do starts at elementary school. By the time she's in college, she's faced with the same dilemma of lack of variety, let alone graduating and not finding the job she feels most passionate about. Many of Saudi's female graduates overseas even find identifying a suitable job as an issue. It’s only as a womenpreneur that choice of what she can do becomes a lot more fruitful.<br />
The right kind of social: There are probably more social entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia per capita than there are entrepreneurs in Dubai, and yes most of them are women. These are the same women who embrace volunteerism, are already part of some network of non profit initiative, and actively spread the word on every social media channel without any ifs and buts. As of this week, Saudi Arabia is still the world’s most Tweeting country on the planet (per capita), the worlds most active Youtube-viewing nation, representing a third of all global daily Youtube views. Saudi youth upload more unique content per day than a few countries combined.<br />
Investors are more interested in an entrepreneurs skills and mindset than in her gender. (Image via Cisco)<br />
Low-income families need supermoms: With the rise of poverty and non-nuclear families, more mothers are put in a position where they must become breadwinners. According to a May 2015 report by the Ministry of Justice, around 82 divorces take place a day in Saudi Arabia. She's either inventing today's new definition of a 'productive family' or fed up with depending on organizations to get by. The grit to achieving financial freedom is a great motivator.<br />
Never before have women been as qualified as they are today: I won't dwell on this too much but here are the hard facts: over 60 percent of all Saudi university graduates are women, and over 60 percent of them are unemployed. It's needless to say that women hold significant economic power as well. Irrespective of what your conclusion is, the truth is that more educated women will be available to work, explore opportunities and become bigger contributors to the economy.<br />
Foundations are in place: Saudi Arabia has over 40 business incubators and plenty of accelerator programs, specialty funds are popping up, and many private investors are beginning to understand what it takes to be an angel investor. New tailored initiatives and programs that take into account the recognition that womenpreneurs must be supported are increasingly becoming more popular.<br />
From local to global: Saudi Arabia is a great market to build scalability on a massive level. It has more established pipelines with global markets than the entirety of the GCC region. Unlike regional startups that tend to rely on markets such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt to scale upwards before they go international, Saudi Arabia enjoys a position of being big enough on its own with the capability of accessing global markets directly.<br />
There hasn't been a better time to become a 'womanpreneur': Entrepreneurship is in itself a viable solution to many socio-economic issues that exist today. The government and the private sector believe that entrepreneurship is a critical component in the formula of creating jobs, building skills, and spreading innovation.<br />
It's fair game territory for you, ladies. You can be whatever you want to be through entrepreneurship. It’s the loophole of all loopholes where the real obstacles are seen as operational, just as a male entrepreneur would face. There are no gender specific issues that prevent you from following your passions and bringing an idea to life. The Saudi startup community is alive and kicking, and women have a role to play like anybody else. Furthermore, this is just the beginning.<br />
To leave you with a Tom Walton quote that pushes me forward every time: "Capital isn't scarce, vision is."<br />

(Image via Aline Mayard)<br />
If you want to understand Morocco’s digital transformation, look no further than the real estate sector. Thanks to the educational efforts of a few early websites, followed by efforts of a handful of international real estate portals with deep pockets, samsars [intermediaries working under the table], promoters, and agencies are slowly moving their business online.While some small local websites have been around for years, like SeleKtimmo which launched in 2009, international websites, like Lamudi or Sarouty, started entering the market a couple of years ago. While Morocco already has an impressive number of real estate platforms, local and international entrepreneurs continue to be attracted by the potential this market represents, and more big international players are to enter the kingdom in the upcoming months. But many believe there isn’t enough room for all those players, so how will it shape up?<br />
An international pattern<br />
“In every country, there are five to six players when the market reaches maturity,” says SeleKtimmo’s cofounder Emmanuelle Boleau. Most of them are following different logics and looking for a different marketing.<br />
In more mature markets, the largest platform is usually the country’s largest classified ads platform where you can sell, buy or lend anything, including apartments, with no intermediary. This is at play in Morocco. “We have the largest inventory, with over 240,000 properties,” says Larbi Alaoui Belrhiti, general manager of Morocco’s largest classified ad website Avito.ma’s. “More than 75 percent of ads are coming for individuals.”<br />
A couple of large specialized platforms are usually also leading the sector. Some are focusing on the quality of the ads other on the number of ads. While Sarouty, the Moroccan edition of MENA’s biggest real estate portal Propertyfinder, and Rocket Internet’s Lamudionly work with agencies and focus on quality,<br />
Mubawab, the 4-year-old real estate portal for the Arab world, is open to anyone. “We want the whole of Morocco’s ads to be published on Mubawab,” says Mubaweb’s cofounder KevinGormand. “I’d rather we have more ads of a lesser quality, but more choice.” <br />
Finally, a couple of smaller local websites open to all, but mostly working with agencies are often part of this picture. Boleau is hoping SeleKtimmo, the website she cofounded in 2009, will be one of those. Webimmo, which was launched two years ago, the newcomer ChariKari, and many more have the same goal.<br />
Success will depend on many factors including convincing agencies to post online, creating the right user experience to convince the web users to use their services, and monetizing fast. <br />
SeleKtimmo's listings were designed for real estate ads.<br />
It takes time and money<br />
A few years back, convincing agencies to post their ads online was a challenge in itself.<br />
“We had to change mentalities,” recalls Gormand, who was among the first to enter the market. “This required patience and time. We had to meet [agencies], convince them, show them it was more interesting to work with us than to print billboards and flyers.”<br />
Market education doesn’t stop there. “When we arrived, agencies didn’t want to post pictures, and prices,” Gormand continues. “In a few years, we managed to convince them to work on the quality of the ads.”<br />
Now, “the message is easy for agencies to understand, but it takes time, especially in small cities,” says Clément Tesconi, country manager for Lamudi. The seven person sales team still meets agencies in person to convince them to join, and then follows up every month, a time and money-consuming strategy.<br />
Unlike Boilau, SeleKtimmo opted to have only one sales representative working from her office on the phone, and focus on the quality of the relationship with the agencies rather than the quantity of the agencies signed up.<br />
So which model is best? Is a seven-person team an unnecessary expense? Can a small team survive now that heavily funded websites have entered the market?<br />
Are you looking for a mansion or cozy apartment? Lamudi offers advanced searches.<br />
Making it easy<br />
Agencies are not the only one who need convincing and educating, as the large chunk of their users are new to the internet. “Part of the market just connected to the internet; we’re in a training phase. We have to adapt to the ways users look for real estate,” says Lamudi’s Tesconi.<br />
The Lamudi team, for instance, added a chat tool on the site.<br />
“We go to the users and ask them directly if they need help,” he explains. “We also noticed that people didn’t want to leave their email address so we enabled them to leave their phone number instead.”<br />
Convincing customers to go online is an expensive struggle. Many channel their funding into market education.<br />
How long can those platforms survive with such heavy budgets?<br />
Mubawab lists housing, offices and land.<br />
It’s all about the money<br />
“[The new comers] will realize that it’s hard to monetize, and will have to ask themselves how much time they can go on without generating revenues,” Gormand notes.<br />
Though each service has its own monetization model, which are best remains to be seen.<br />
Avito.ma makes money by selling banners to advertisers and by allowing customers to create “stores”.  In the upcoming months, they will also offer paying services to individuals, such as sponsored ads. “Our goal is to generate profit in the upcoming years,” explains Belrhiti.<br />
Lamudi offers a 360 degree approach. They charge agencies for the publication of ads, consulting services, creating custom websites, flyers, and more. In 2015, the company will break even due to scale economy on the international level, Tesconi says.<br />
Mubawab and SeleKtimmo have already broken even by selling different levels of visibility on their websites.<br />
“The first year was tough, but after a year we convinced the agencies, they renewed [their subscription] and many joined,” Boleau says. “After the second year, we were breaking even.”<br />
<br />
 It doesn't get much simpler than an Avito ad.<br />
Low operating costs helped. <br />
“We have between three and four employees. We never spend much compared to the newcomers.”<br />
Those small profitable players don’t necessarily aim to getting bigger, preferring to be profitable. “I’m not losing clients, I’m gaining new ones,” Boleau says. “This is an indication of success.”<br />
The other ones, which have huge costs due to their large team and advertising budget will need to generate huge revenue streams to make up for their costs. But are the Moroccan residents willing to spend enough money to create revenue for all of them?<br />
“There can’t be that many website in the end,” Gormand says. “I don’t think there will be mergers/acquisitions, the market is not ready for that,” he adds, pointing out that no website has the budget for that. “I think some websites will have to close.”<br />
While most managers Wamda spoke with seemed optimistic about their websites, it is difficult to get a clear indication about the health of the real estate sector. In such a competitive sector, it is hard to know which numbers are actually accurate. And the numbers of ads, or pageviews hardly reflects how many transactions are done, or how profitable the platforms are. If Gormand’s prediction proves correct, we’ll know soon enough who is not doing as well as they seem to be.<br />

The startup, Ramallah-based RedCrow Intelligence, provides detailed reports for clients working in unstable areas, drawing on raw data from open-source information, human intelligence sources, and social networks. <br />
Daily reports include graphs that categorize specific incidents such as search-and-arrest military operations, clashes, attacks or injuries, among others, while monthly and weekly reports provide the broader geopolitical context. These might offer a breakdown of incidents in Israeli-controlled areas versus those in Palestinian Authority-controlled areas, or predictions of possible ripple effects such as the increased likelihood of hostilities stemming from sudden economic insecurity.<br />
One source of real-time information about potential threats is social media. RedCrow Intelligence's web-based system monitors information from think tanks, mass media, and blogs and measures it according to each source’s credibility.<br />

In August last year RedCrow Intelligence received $20,000 in seed funding from Fast Forward, a seed accelerator for tech nonprofits in Ramallah, and signed its first client six months later. <br />
Today, the team has expanded to eight members: in addition to CEO Hussein Nasser-Eddin and COO Laila Akel, the startup includes web and product development teams and a business development department.<br />
RedCrow Intelligence’s current clients are primarily international NGOs, governmental organizations, foreign delegations, and some private sector businesses and individuals.<br />
“The segment RedCrow Intelligence is targeting starts to gradually concentrate in its early stages on diplomatic security, such as embassies and major international humanitarian NGOs operating in the MENA region,” Nasser-Eddin says. “This segment enables RCI to concentrate on the main users of the security market in the MENA region and to develop its product based on the feedback of the most demanding professionals in the industry, such as field operators and diplomatic security officers.” <br />
The team also hopes to provide services to travelers, international staff, and freelance journalists working in the MENA region.<br />
“There are several Palestinian security companies that do operate in the Israeli market private sector," Nasser-Eddin added. "Still, according to my knowledge, none of the Palestinian security companies or startups – including RedCrow Intelligence – provide their products and services to the Israeli government." <br />
 <br />
Realtime alerts pinpoint incident and location.<br />
RedCrow Intelligence uses five threat levels to communicate risk to clients. <br />
The founders say the lowest threat level, Level 1, is rarely seen in MENA. Level 2 is triggered by incidents such as government-approved demonstrations and Level 3 may include major natural disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, or violence towards government officials. Level 4 covers issues frequently seen in Palestine, for example, such as power cuts, water shortages, difficulty or danger when traveling between different areas, and civil unrest. Level 5 is the most severe and includes military hostilities, the evacuation or closure of embassies, curfews, and martial law. <br />
Operating in the MENA region isn’t always easy, but more because of the technical challenges than the security ones.  <br />
“The nature of areas of political conflicts create barriers and challenges that require extra efforts to compensate for the absence of 3G technology or poor mapping,” Nasser-Eddin says. <br />
“We created other services to solve these problems without affecting the efficiency of our product, such as an SMS service that provides minute-by-minute alerts to our clients and maps that are filled in manually with the missing data.”<br />
The web-based system offers information related to security.<br />
The plan is to launch a comprehensive mobile app by the end of 2015. This will link alerts to a local map so users can monitor the security level in their area, and pinpoint the location of specific threats as they happen. The app will include the same features available on the online platform, such as statistics and long-term security analysis, but also minute-by-minute alerts and early warnings that notify users if there’s a risk nearby. <br />
Hussein Nasser-Eddin says it's crucially important to have a local team working on the ground. <br />
The team’s native grasp of colloquial and regional dialects, and of cultural nuances, helps them efficiently process the constant flow of information from residents - a common challenge for international intelligence companies. <br />

RedCrow Intelligence aims to offer services to the whole Palestinian market by the end of this year, expanding to Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria by 2017.<br />
 “By 2019, we are aiming to cover the whole MENA region,” Akel says. “We will eventually end with three main offices that cover the Levant, the Gulf and North Africa.”<br />
In the context of the political and economic state of the MENA region, where political change and unrest are daily concerns, the startup’s willingness to innovate with technology is a prerequisite for success.<br />

(Image via BDD)<br />
For 17 years Chileans endured a right-wing military dictatorship that saw more than 3,000 people either killed or go missing. For the Lebanese it was a nearly 20-year civil war left up to 17,000 dead or missing.<br />
But Chile and Lebanon share more than these raw, chilling similarities. They share a love of food, mountainous landscapes that rush into warm seas, and more recently, a mildly burgeoning startup community.<br />
Recently, over the course of a week, organized by the World Bank as part of their Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project, four Chilean entrepreneurs and ecosystem collaborators visited Lebanon and met with various members of the startup ecosystem. The objective being to learn from, and share, ecosystem experiences.<br />
Chile is moving much faster than Lebanon towards a mature entrepreneurial ecosystem: in 2010, the South American country birthed Start-Up Chile, a product of the Chilean government looking to grow their underground startup ecosystem.<br />
The organization was a novel one in that the pilot project invited foreigners, not Chileans, to start businesses in Chile and offered a $40,000 equity-free grant and one year work visa. It&rsquo;s not surprising, then, that by 2013 Chile played host to 750 new businesses and eventually opened their doors to Chileans.&nbsp;<br />
&mdash; Start-Up Chile (@startupchile)&nbsp;July 23, 2015<br />
Sebastian Vidal, Start-Up Chile&rsquo;s executive director was one of the visiting Chileans.<br />
Be a doer, not a talker<br />
Towards the end of their week, at an event entitled &lsquo;A conversation with Chile&rsquo;s changemakers&rsquo; Start-Up Chile&rsquo;s Sebastian Vidal, executive director of the seed accelerator, shared the idea that part of the accelerator&rsquo;s initial battle was to prove to Chileans that this was something their country needed. His finding? &ldquo;A pilot program is important&rdquo;, he said, whether you&rsquo;re an ecosystem supporter or a startup.<br />
&ldquo;(Chile is) an ecosystem built by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs,&rdquo; said Ali Makhzoum after the &lsquo;conversation&rsquo;. Mahkzoum, the cofounder of soon-to-launch agri startup LifeLab BioDesign, was very enamoured by this point: &ldquo;banks and VCs often don&rsquo;t get it, the hunger that we have [for progression].&rdquo;<br />
Finding that entrepreneurs in Lebanon and Chile had similar worries, the World Bank&rsquo;s Victor Mulas believed a conversation between the two ecosystems would be beneficial. &ldquo;Both countries are in a similar stage with their ecosystems,&rdquo; he told Wamda.<br />
Carolina Rossi, founder of the car sharing service yebame and now head of the Social Innovation Lab at Finis Tarrae University in Santiago, noted the similarities and differences. In particular she noted how an active Lebanese diaspora was of benefit to growing the ecosystem, something Chile didn&rsquo;t have.<br />
&ldquo;Lebanon diaspora is just, amazing, it has a huge amount of talent living abroad,&rdquo; she said to Wamda. &ldquo;They have this global vision of moving out of Lebanon to generate change.&rdquo;<br />
Learning from one another<br />
&ldquo;Chile is a very isolated country and doesn&rsquo;t have a history of entrepreneurship,&rdquo; said Mulas, talking about what the Latin American country could learn from Lebanon. Unlike Lebanon where they had to work on keeping the talent at home, Chile was in a position of needing to grow that talent and changing mindsets about entrepreneurship.<br />
And part of this growing change, according to Rossi, is about connecting people. &ldquo;This country has everything to lead in the region. You just need to connect the dots, generate collaboration and unite the entrepreneurial forces to achieve one same goal: position Lebanon as the hub of innovation for the MENA region.&rdquo;<br />
One of the ways in which Mulas felt that Lebanon might excel was in the creation of something similar to Chile&rsquo;s Ideas Factory. Described as a meeting point for all those within the startup ecosystem, from investors to testing labs, their aim is to keep growing an integrated and collaborative environment.<br />
Alejandra Winter, the operations director at Ideas Factory, spoke about how adding value to an economy, which was largely commodities based, was key to their ecosystem growing. In Lebanon, the Beirut Digital District (BDD) is on a course to becoming something similar, in providing a physical, and connected network for ecosystem players. <br />
&ldquo;We were inspired by their stories of entrepreneurial transformation,&rdquo; said BDD&rsquo;s Christelle Abou Jaoude, adding that they would be taking some of their actions in Chile, on board in Lebanon. <br />

(Images via Samuel Wendel)<br />
Twelve Jordanian startups gathered as regional finalists in the SeedStars World competition on July 26 at Oasis500’s headquarters in Amman. They pitched their companies in front of a crowd of onlookers and a six-man jury in hopes of advancing on to the global competition. But at the end of the day, there was only one startup left standing: Arabic-language ebookstore Yaqut. <br />
The competition was fierce, and the margin of victory thin. After a scheduled 30-minute jury deliberation stretched to 45 minutes, it reconvened and Seedstar’s loquacious show-runner announced the finalists.<br />
In third was Play3arabi, a tech startup offering free-to-play mobile games focused on social and multiplayer games for Arabic speakers and represented by Joseph Shomali.<br />
In second was Redtroops and Samer Tarazi, below, who pitched his company’s interactive auction-based marketplace for in-app advertisements that bridges the gap between app developers and advertisers.<br />
But in the six minutes allotted by Seedstars to pitch - along with a four minute question and answer session - Yaqut’s CEO Ammar Mardawi won the jury over with a powerful description of his startup’s gamfied and ad-subsidized Arabic eBookstore developed for smartphones and tablets.<br />
His prize? An all-inclusive trip to Geneva, Switzerland in early 2016, where Mardawi will face-off against 50-70 other regional winners in a final pitching competition - at the end of which a global winner will be crowned.<br />
The competition in Geneva will be stiffer, but the reward for the winner of the Seedstars World competition will be far more than a plane ticket.<br />
Redtroops' Samer Tarazi is awarded 2nd place in the Seedstars Amman competition.<br />
The grand prize is up to $1.5 million in equity investment, and access to Seedstar’s network of investors.<br />
And although only Yaqut emerged from Oasis500 in the running for this lucrative prize, the event’s competition featured some of Jordan’s brightest young startups.<br />
“Almost all the participating startups had won other awards before and it was particularly surprising that Yaqut came in first place,” says Mardawi. “Winning the competition is an outstanding confirmation that we're on the right path with our technology and business model.”<br />
And Yaqut has reason to be pleased, especially considering the event’s keynote speech came from an alumnus of the competition, Feesheh’s Nur Alfayez, a company who’s found success since winning the regional round last year.<br />
In order to be a part of the competition, startups had to be selected after an application process featuring some 3,000+ applicants from across the world - 600 of which made the cut. To qualify, the startups needed to be less than two years old, have raised less than $500,000 to date, and have a minimum viable product.<br />
The other startups who participated were: Cash Basha, an e-commerce platform allowing Jordanians to shop on amazon.com and pay locally with cash; Kama, a Middle Eastern food and design startup; Mimix, an app that translates speech to sign language; Project io, a 3D visualization and image processing company; Riskopy, an online risk management toolkit for SMEs; Snackable News, a platform featuring sponsored news stories in English and Arabic; TravoTech, an online booking platform designed to help travel agencies migrate to the web; Trazec, a software tech company offering improved text rendering technology; and Trevx, an audio search engine where users can search for all types of audio files.<br />
The jury tasked with judging the finalists included: Oasis500’s Chief Coach Nidal Qanadilo; Oasis500’s Investment Analyst Faisal Al Bitar; iMENA’s Head of Business Development Anas Elayyan; Madfoo3atCOM’s CEO Nasser Saleh; ArabiaWeather’s CPA Yousef Wadi; and Igor Ovcharenko, Seedstar's regional manager for CEE/MENA.<br />
Seedstars World competition now travels on - it will be in Beirut on September 3, and Dubai on September 16.<br />

Arab diasporas are a true mosaic. Some left the Middle East to look for a better life;  others fled conflicts, some leaving for good, others just for a few years. Some grew up in the Arab world, others were born outside of the region. Some don’t even speak Arabic – or never saw their ancestral country. But behind this extreme heterogeneity, diasporas are goldmines in terms of resources, skills, connections and time.<br />
Diasporas are not a magic stick for the Middle Eastern startup ecosystem (nor its economy). Arab diaspora engagement is a challenge for regional organizations for various reasons. Yet Arab diasporas matter. Opportunities to involve diasporas in the Middle East startup ecosystem are underestimated. Here are four.<br />
Arab diaspora communities can be found all over the world, and some are willing and able to assist their communities in countries of origins. (Image via My Home Improvement)<br />
1. Historical support<br />
Arab diasporas show a powerful attachment to their countries of origin or descent. They did and do much for the region – spontaneously.<br />
According to the World Bank, official remittances (money transfers to family and friends) represented over one tenth of GDP in Levantine countries in 2013 (Lebanon 18 percent, Palestine 14 percent, Jordan 11 percent – statistics is not available for Syria). In that year, remittances made up over $13 billion in these three countries alone.<br />
Arab diasporas also set up their own organizations, for charity and business among others. In particular, they built bridges between Middle Eastern entrepreneurs and other markets or ecosystems – especially the US. They initiated entities like TechWadi (for startups in the Arab world) and Rise Egypt (for social ventures in Egypt).<br />
Diasporas not only helped the region their way, they also answered calls for help.<br />
In 1991, when Lebanon was on its knees following the civil war, the country raised 52 billion Lebanese pounds (35 million USD) in diaspora treasury bonds aimed to alleviate government debt (as explained by Guita Hourani).<br />
The war in Syria fuelled extensive medical and philanthropic diaspora relief. The Union of the Syrian Medical Relief Organisations (UOSSM), an umbrella organization launched at the beginning of the war, gathers multiple medical Syrian diaspora entities. In fact many Syrian diaspora entities were set up during the conflict – 20 to 30 organizations across North America, Europe and the Middle East, according to a 2015 report by HPG and ODI.<br />
A similar phenomenon happened in Lebanon in the year following the 2006 war. Remittance increased to unprecedented levels in absolute and relative terms – reaching an astonishing 24 percent of GDP in 2007 according to the World Bank.<br />
2. The pan-Arab opportunity<br />
Individual Middle Eastern diasporas are lucky to share a common denominator, cultural and linguistic (despite dialects).<br />
The US boasts a number of such entities. They include the Arab Bankers Association of North America or ABANA (a network of financial diaspora professionals); and PITME, an accelerator program for Middle Eastern startups (launched by the German-Persian Nima Adelkhani in California).<br />
The Pan-Arab sense among Middle Eastern diasporas is an opportunity for a region where cross-country cooperation, from trade tariffs to business standards, is rare.<br />
First, joint Arab diaspora initiatives offer economies of scale and enhanced visibility. This is especially relevant in a startup context, as entrepreneurs struggle to create awareness nationally and globally. The need is even greater in the Levant, where individual markets are small. If multiple national websites were to replace the current Wamda platform, for example, many MENA entrepreneurs and innovations would go unnoticed.<br />
Second, Internal battles can ruin diaspora initiatives. The pan-Arab dimension limits risks of politicization and conflicts. For instance, the World Lebanese Cultural Union (WLCU), formerly the main Lebanese diaspora organization, was deprived of its power and credibility in the 1975-1990 war in Lebanon. Similarly, the Syrian war is a source of tension within its diaspora – for example between Sunni, Alawi and Kurdish Syrians, but also within these groups as reported in 2015 by International Alert. Still, pan-Arab initiatives are a chance for each national diaspora to shift away from national conflicts.<br />
They may be abroad, but some Arabs in the diaspora have shown a remarkable attachment to their lands of origin. (Image via Morocco World News)<br />
3. Allies in academia and foreign governments<br />
In recent years, universities and host states provided precious help to Arab diaspora initiatives. In host countries like the United States, initiatives are numerous: Among others are the annual Harvard Arab Weekend, the MIT Pan-Arab Enterprise Forum, and AMENDS (American Middle Eastern Network for Dialogue at Stanford).<br />
Conversely, universities in the Arab world, like American University of Beirut (AUB) and American University in Cairo (AUC) – have been key to link diasporas to the Middle East.<br />
Universities in the region are generally trusted. They benefit from relative neutrality politically and religiously; and from the overall interest of Arab diasporas in education and youth. Middle Eastern universities partner with diaspora entities and maintain relationships with their alumni networks worldwide. Locally, they support Arab students and (increasingly) entrepreneurs, through initiatives like the AUC Venture Lab.<br />
Also, governments of host countries are increasingly interested – and involved –in business projects involving diasporas: The enhanced public attention towards diaspora communities is compounded with a rising appetite for startups and innovations in general.<br />
The United States supported Jordan’s business and entrepreneurship ecosystem by involving the US Jordanian community – notably through the USAID Jordan Competitiveness Program launched in 2013.<br />
France runs a program called PACEIM to incubate innovative MENA startups launched by its Maghreb and Lebanese grads.<br />
The UK, jointly with Lebanon (including the Lebanese Central Bank), launched the UK Lebanon Tech Hub (UKLTH) in 2015 to accelerate the growth of Lebanese startups and SMEs. The UKLTH intends to establish partnerships with the Lebanese diaspora in the UK, and acceleration partly happens in London.<br />

4. A favorable ecosystem<br />
The global ecosystem is ripe to ease diaspora outreach. It is now easy to donate towards arts initiatives on Aflamnah, contribute financially to innovative projects on Zoomaal, or invest in small businesses on Eureeca. Virtual networks have been launched to connect diaspora people in tech – as with the US-Lebanese LebNet and US-Jordanian Connect.Jo communities.<br />
Other tools, like Namsor, are still niche but promising. Namsor is a SAAS (software as a service) platform that leverages data analytics to recognize the country of origin of anyone based on names, with a 80 to 95 percent success. It offers several services based on its diaspora mapping algorithm – essentially a combination of machine learning and sociolinguistics. Clients have used it in several countries (such as Lithuania, Ireland and France), among others for FDI attraction, VC/angel identification, and scientist repatriation.<br />
Yet beyond technology, physical places are being rediscovered for diaspora engagement.<br />
Diaspora members typically buy food at grocery stores and eat dishes from their countries of origin at restaurants. In certain cases, they visit their country of descent – for family reasons or simply for tourism. Some even have a bank account there. All these places - food stores, restaurants, airlines and airports, banks, and others - are possible points of contacts with diasporas, and they are starting to be explored in a more formal manner.<br />
In 2013, Turkish Airlines started its Invest on Board program to showcase Turkish startups on flights – raising the visibility of Turkey’s entrepreneurs among Turkish travellers and diaspora members.<br />
External partners, innovations and previous diaspora support show that much could be done with Arab diasporas. Middle Eastern economies and societies could definitely benefit from it. When will the diaspora become a long-term priority in the Middle East – beyond times of elections or fundraising?<br />

(Image via McIlwraith Education)<br />
Want a recipe for a perfect disaster, one that has been brewing for years? Take a severely strained education sector and add a demographic boom to it. That's the situation in Algeria.<br />
 <br />
Fortunately, several entrepreneurs are utilizing technology to improve the situation. Some are offering online courses that are accessible for all; others are providing schools with educational kits. Three services aim to improve education in Algeria.<br />
<br />
Strained educational sector<br />
 <br />
Complaints against Algeria’s education system keep flooding in.<br />
“The population has grown very quickly and so there was a need to recruit many professors, without, however, the capacity to offer them adequate training courses,” laments Kamel Haddar, founder of Algérie-Focus and iMadrassa (Arabic for iSchool).<br />
Teacher strikes, overcrowded classroom and inadequate textbooks are undermining the education of young Algerians, according to Karim Sidi Saïd, founder of Dirassatti (Algerian for “my studies”).<br />
“Algerian schoolbooks lack information and don’t provide the correct way to solve the exercises proposed,” he says. <br />
Underscoring the urgent need for educational reform, many students rely on private lessons.<br />
“Today, we need new technologies in order to offer scalable-quality education,” Haddar says.<br />
 He is referring to education that is timely, accessible and low-cost. <br />
While Sidi Saïd, 21, launched Dirassatti to fulfill his personal need, Haddar by a duty he felt as a citizen when he developed iMadrassa. <br />
“Education contributes to economic development, but also to peace and tolerance,” Haddar says. “If we educate our children, there won’t be any more “Da3ech” [ISIS].” <br />
Courses, in his opinion, should be dedicated to the correction of exercises and not for the teaching of the lessons which can be easily learned at home, and which can be found abundantly on the internet.<br />
Dirassatti aims to help students learn<br />
Dirassatti offers exercises, quizzes, video courses, and evaluation sheets. (Image via Dirassatti)<br />
Dirassatti offers clear, educational resources and content in one place. Launched about a year ago, the service provides senior-year high school coursework and quizzes in math, physics, and life and earth science, all prepared by national education teachers in conformity with curriculum set by the Ministry of Education. Coursework is offered in written form or videos.<br />
Dirassatti got a boost 2014 after Sidi Saïd won the 2014 edition of the Tstart business plan competition, and consequently obtained funding, coaching, and a place to work at telecom operator Ooredoo’s incubator. The team consists of six members and 10 teachers/consultants. They hope to offer content for all Algerian school levels in two years.<br />
In the future, the site will start offering a premium version. Wamda not able to obtain further information as to the number of users, or additional details about the the premium version. <br />
iMadrassa: ambitious services for students<br />

After marketing the French educational support site, Maxicours, to French private school students under the name of iMadrassa in Algeria and of Madrasatti.ma in Morocco, Haddar has decided to offer the Algerian curriculum too, by creating a platform and developing content in conformity with the country’s national education curricula.<br />
iMadrassa provides students with lessons from the national curricula, as well as quizzes, long exercises, and soon videos that illustrate solutions. They will be created by recently-retired professors and validated by a second team of professors and students. Launched last May, the service offers a high school senior level curriculum at the moment, but intends to offer subject matter for the rest of high school levels the beginning of next year. <br />
And while a part of the content is accessible free of charge, students will have to pay between 500 and 950 Algerian dinars ($5 to $9.55) per month to access all of the content. Without revealing any numbers, Haddar insists Wamda the service is doing well. <br />
The startup is also working with telecom operators and mobile phone/tablet manufacturers to deploy its service. <br />
The entrepreneur intends to sell Algérie-Focus to concentrate on iMadrassa. He aims to acquiring three percent of the market in the next four years. He also hopes to delve into remote school support in a second phase. <br />
The team is expected to grow from just four to 15 in the coming 10 months. They already have a somebody dedicated for development of the service in Africa and the Middle East. Their goal? Ten countries within the next five years. For this reason, and to promote the service in Algeria, the entrepreneur is seeking to raise 1 million euros from local and international business angels.<br />
Dirassatic: tools for school<br />
Dirassatic's dashboard.<br />
Dirassatic (Arabic for “your education”) is an online management tool. Students and parents are granted access to education related information, from class schedule to absences, notices, and grades.<br />
Dirassatic was created and funded by Dynamic Web Solutions, an Algerian web agency, and Hichem Mebarki, a 25-year-old web developer. The service was launched last September, after two years of preparation, and has a five-member team.<br />
For the time being, the service will be operating in around fifteen private establishments (at primary, middle, and high school levels) in Algeria. <br />
“Convincing these schools wasn’t a piece of cake,” admits Hichem Mebarki, “but fortunately, a large number of these establishments was looking for a similar solution.” <br />
The entrepreneur intends to spread his solution across Algeria, followed by Morocco and Tunisia by September, and to target higher education next year.<br />
And whenever schools don’t have the necessary budget to acquire this solution, Dirassatic will offer parents, as of September, the option of paying for the service themselves. However, the school will still have to play its part and enter the information. <br />
Given the enthusiasm of Algerians for new technologies and the speed at which young people have become accustomed to 3G, one can only have high hopes for these services. And the question is now whether or not Algerians are ready to pay for such services.<br />

Amidst the festive atmosphere of Ramadan, Intel in Egypt launched INARA, its latest youth initiative, on July 8. The initiative aims to support youth innovation by enhancing their educational status and enabling the skills they need.<br />
<br />
The INARA initiative, which comes as Intel celebrates 10-years in the Middle East, has previously been launched in the UAE, and is part of its CSR strategy taking a particular interest in youth education programs.<br />
Since 2004 they have been active in the field and their investments have included the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), launched in 2005, and its Technology Development Lab and Higher Education Initiative at Nile University, launched in 2007.<br />
Three cornerstones for future developments<br />
INARA wants to tackle the whole MENA region, and to do so they say they have three cornerstones in order to create a knowledge-based economy in the Arab world: education, science and technology, and entrepreneurship.<br />
"At Intel we believe that enlightening the youth with 21st century skills, combined with a strong focus on math and science has become a necessity in the highly competitive and fast changing global job market,” said Taha Khalifa, Intel's regional GM.<br />

<br />
A summary of Intel's achievements in its community development projects boasts some large numbers in education, innovation and entrepreneurship. <br />
Around 1.5 million schoolteachers from 12 different Arab countries have received training on modern educational tools and student engagement from the Intel Teach program. This program adopts a "train-the-trainer" method where every school chooses a representative trainer-to-be to attend the program along with other trainers. After successfully completing the course and gaining the program coordinator's approval, the teacher's mission would be to then train 10 to 20 colleagues in the same school.<br />
More than 450,000 students had participated at the Intel ISEF, which was launched in 2010. The students hailed from 13 different Arab countries, including Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman. The exhibition encourages students to create primary solution models for current problems.<br />
As for entrepreneurship, more than 20,000 young entrepreneurs had participated in the Intel Challenge MENA competition in 2014, where the winners had the chance to visit Silicon Valley and benefit from worldwide expertise.<br />
The event was attended by youth from different age groups, all of whom had benefited from Intel's development programs, including 17-year-old Yasmine Yehya, winner of the Intel ISEF 2015 Grand Award in Earth and Environmental Sciences, held last May in Pittsburgh, USA.  Yehya's project was "Rice Straw Power", a device that utilizes rice straw as fuel for recycling water to render it drinkable. Yehya expressed her delight at being given the chance to participate in the science fair, describing it as a "huge opportunity" for youth to display their talents.<br />

<br />
<br />
INARA's goal is that by 2019 they have given one million citizens with the skills and know-how needed to be part of their country's economic growth and its competitive edge. The campaign's strategy includes a series of workshops, programs and courses that span three areas: Ideation Camp, a workshop to provide participants with innovation skills training, Intel Learn, for skills needed in the future workforce market, and E-basics, a training program to build a business plan.<br />
Growing options<br />
Another strategy is the Nata’alam initiative.<br />
Nata’alam is an online Arabic community that provides resources and tools to empower teachers and educators with technical know-how through webinars, lesson plans and current materials. Nata’alam aims to engage 300,000 educators in the community by 2019.<br />
Aside from Intel's endeavors, several other online educational initiatives have emerged in the region, like Egypt's Edraak and Saudi's Rwaq. Both are educational platforms that provide online interactive material for online learners, teachers and students alike.<br />
With the support of local and regional partners, Intel intends to open networking channels between entrepreneurs and incubators through its "Intel Innovation Hub". The center also offers seed investment as well as mentoring opportunities with Intel's local partners.<br />
 INARA's launching was perfectly timed with the generous spirit of Ramadan, where various communities volunteer and participate in development programs. The event was attended a handful of executives in Egypt, including supervisors in the Technology and Innovation Center (TIEC) of Nile University, journalists and government official like Atef Helmy, former minister of communications and IT.<br />
On the whole, this initiative seems a perfect extension to Intel's community development projects. Yet we await to see the level of interaction and interest shown by the target group, students and teachers alike.<br />

“We use disruptive technology to improve human rights fulfilment in conflict zones and host communities,” that is how Loay Malhameh, cofounder of 3D MENA Social Innovation, and Dave Levin, founder and executive director of Refugee Open Ware, present the products they are building within their initiatives.<br />
During our latest Mix N’ Mentor in Amman, we had the chance to chat with the cofounders.<br />
Based out of Amman, the two are looking to use the most advanced technologies for those that need it the most, like displaced and host communities affected by conflict.<br />
In this video, the cofounders tell us how they want to make the most out of the new industrial revolution in order to benefit people in need.  "Our idea is to bring the Third Industrial Revolution to the humanitarian sector to try address these terrible crises that we are facing,” says Levin.<br />
Watch the video to learn how a team member who had lost his leg during the Syrian war was taught how to program and code in Arduino in three days, and built his first prosthetics prototype in three weeks. Now teaching others how to do the same Levin says “this is a good test case on how accessible these technologies are for the people we are trying to help.” <br />

Read on. (Image via The Sales Lion)<br />
“We’re thinking about marketing for our startup but we’re not sure if content marketing is the right way to go. Do you think there’s enough ROI there to make it worthwhile?”<br />
I get asked questions like this all the time by startups who want to bring in more customers, but are apprehensive about the cost, involvement and the ROI.<br />
They’re usually surprised by my response.<br />
They don’t expect me to say that not only is content marketing one of the most affordable methods of traffic and lead generation – it’s also got long-term value, residual benefits that play into SEO, social media, customer satisfaction, conversion rate optimization and so much more.<br />
If you’re one of those startups sitting on the fence, I want to give you five really good reasons why investing in content marketing is going to pay you huge dividends.<br />
1. Content builds credibility<br />
Your customers need to know three critical things about your business:<br />
<br />
You’re competent<br />
You’re credible<br />
You’re likeable <br />
<br />
Content marketing gives you the chance to address all three. <br />
When you share content that outlines your expertise or digs into a topic they want to learn about, you’re playing the role of the authority, giving them faith in your ability to do the job you’re promising to do. <br />
This gives your customers a clear understanding of your competence; they can see for themselves the way that you think through problems and address issues, and they also learn to see you as a trustworthy information source – that’s the credibility part. <br />
The voice and tone you use to write the content also gives your customers a sense of your brand’s personality and values. <br />
They learn what you’re all about and how you communicate. If you can entertain them while they’re learning from you, you’ll grow to be seen as a likeable brand – and that positive emotional connection makes it more likely they’ll buy from you and stay a loyal customer. <br />
2. Content fuels social engagement and exposure<br />
Social media without content marketing is lifeless.<br />
If you want to have something to talk about with your customers (other than answering their questions and handling their complaints), you need to be either creating or curating content that’s interesting to them.<br />
Content marketing gives your brand the ability to steer the conversation in whatever direction you choose. You can showcase your competence in a specific area, give customers a conversation point, or educate your following on an issue you know they care about.<br />
Your content can be repurposed on social media in a multitude of ways, too – whether it’s turning statistics into clever snapshots and infographics or adding quotes to images for a visual impact.<br />
Content marketing gives your customers a point of entry into your website and a sense of familiarity with your brand that makes it more likely they’ll buy from you over time.<br />

3. Content marketing is a powerful SEO tool<br />
If you want to rank well in search, you need two important things:<br />
<br />
High-quality links from trusted websites<br />
Original content that pertains to the keywords you want to target<br />
<br />
Content marketing gives you both. <br />
You can create content that surrounds certain keywords or phrases you want to rank for – phrases that it might be more difficult to work into your primary website due to constraints or on-page conversion funnels. <br />
This gives Google lots of unique content to chew through and improves the topical relevance of your entire domain, improving the likelihood that you’ll rank well in search.<br />
Then, when that content gets shared and talked about, you’ll earn quality links naturally – the way Google loves. <br />
You can be deliberate about your content marketing and target specific hubs, interest groups or audiences who have the ability to give you a link back.<br />
The result is a much more powerful website that’s able to outrank your competition and earn links that they can’t copy.<br />
4. Content creates and captures new customersEven if you’ve got the greatest landing pages and website copy on the planet, you’re still missing out on customers and conversions if you’re not using content to generate leads.<br />
For example, a guide or ebook on a subject your audience is interested in can be used to generate leads by giving it to them in exchange for their email address – empowering you to remarket to them and send offers on an ongoing basis.<br />
Blog posts and articles, as I mentioned, improve your credibility and competence – but can also be used to hit on customer pain points and help them realize their need for a product or service like yours. <br />
And you can use content to target keywords that show clear buyer’s intent, getting more qualified leads on your site in the moments they’re considering options and solutions.<br />
The more relevant content you create, the more lines you’ll have out in the water to potentially hook an interested lead.<br />

5. Content marketing is affordable (really!)<br />
None of the benefits above would be worth it if content marketing cost a fortune to implement – but the honest truth is that it doesn’t need to.<br />
Yes, you will need to pay for someone to research, plan and edit the content if you are unable to do this yourself. And yes, you will need to invest in a promotion strategy for the content. But there are ways to make both of those options incredibly efficient:<br />
<br />
Set a content schedule you can manage:   Don’t listen to anyone who says you have to publish “X” amount of content for it to be effective. Just commit to producing what makes sense for your budget and resources; anything is better than nothing<br />
<br />
<br />
Repurpose content to get more bang for your buckA huge part of the cost of content is the planning and ideation phases, where you generate and research ideas. Instead of coming up with new ideas every time, it makes much more sense to choose one big idea, research it in depth, then produce multiple pieces of content based around that same theme.For example, you could create an ebook, then turn that ebook into smaller posts and guest posts for sharing on your own site (and pushing people back to download the ebook, which gets you their email). Any stats in the ebook could be turned into tweetables, images and infographics.You can stretch one piece of content a very long way – and once you have it, you can market it over and over again.<br />
Produce some content yourselfYou don’t have to love to write or be an expert designer to create content. You can lend your abilities to video, podcasts, webinars, Slideshares and much more. There are plenty of mediums you can create on, and the ability to create on your own can bring down the overall cost – so long as you’ve got the time to manage. If you don’t…<br />
Source work from the same people repeatedlyInstead of working with a huge group of different writers or designers, finding just one or two who you trust to deliver can be more cost effective as they’ll save you time on the research and editing end. They’ll get to know your business, and by doing so, get used to producing content in your style and to your preferences. <br />
<br />
So, yes – you should invest in content marketing. Put aside those fears and trepidations – there’s a lot to love about content marketing, and a ton that it can do for you. If you want to build your brand, engage your customers, improve your SEO, capture more leads and keep customers coming back, content really isn’t optional – and it’s time you started reaping the benefits.<br />

But if you look at an ecommerce map of the country, you find that high population density is a key reason why Egypt ranks alongside the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for the highest number of ecommerce customers in the Middle East. Indeed, Egypt tops this market with 30 million ecommerce users, or one third of the total online buyers in the region.<br />
It’s these numbers that are encouraging new ventures into Egyptian ecommerce. <br />

DealGamed <br />
About two years ago Wamda noted the absence of competitors to Edfa3ly, the Egyptian international shopper service that lets local customers buy from US websites and pay locally.<br />
Yet Edfa3ly's first competitor, DealGamed, appeared only six months ago with a site allowing customers to shop internationally at prices that include Egyptian customs taxes.<br />
The startup operates on the same model as Edfa3ly, which now runs the online shopping website Yashry. <br />
"DealGamed offers the same services (as we do), and is our main competitor," said Ahmed Mohammed, one of Edfa3ly's three cofounders. "But we are betting on our entrepreneurship (innovation) in this field, and on our partners' loyalty, as well as the elite program which we recently launched."<br />
"By participating in this program and paying a fee for six months, a customer can get the product he orders without paying customs or shipping fees," Mohammed said. <br />
DealGamed by the numbers<br />
Mohammed refused to reveal any numbers around unique browsers or the value of purchases, but DealGamed’s digital marketing manager Ayman ElHakim - who used to work for Edfa3ly - had no such reservations. <br />
"The steps we (at DealGamed) took in the previous six months were phenomenal," he said. "We managed to attract a considerable portion of our target market. We have 80,000 to 100,000 monthly visits (on the website). Also, the number of monthly purchases reached 1,500 purchases, and this helped us to break even with our monthly costs, which is in line with our plan to reach a total tie by the end of the year." <br />
DealGamed executive director Mustapha ElBatesh says these numbers can be attributed to two factors: sound strategic planning and the “amazing work experiences" of the company.<br />
"All employees come from international corporations and have lengthy experience in their field. They go through several selection processes until they are recruited to join the team." <br />
DealGamed’s founders are looking forward to securing Series A investment, after receiving seed funding from an American investor who decided to take the risk, despite the fact that the company is registered in the US. <br />
"(If) we get the investment round, we will be able to diversify the offers we currently have on our local and international platforms," said ElHakim. "This way, we can increase our sales and raise our overall financial position." <br />

Saboobaa <br />
"Our platform enables users to sell and buy items under one umbrella," Mahmoud Elfeky says of his almost year old venture Saboobaa, named after the Egyptian slang for an additional source of income.<br />
"We very well know that Egypt has a lot of talented and skilled [individuals] who want to increase their income, so we decided to launch Saboobaa so these youth can have an extra source of income by using their skills and abilities," he told Wamda. <br />
"We don't deal with second hand items, all of the products featured on our website are 100 percent new, and they involve various fields like food and beverage, clothes, medical consultations and even specialized skills that can be marketed by individuals." <br />
The cofounders have noticed that the highest website visit rates come from women who use the site to buy or display food and handmade products. <br />
As for delivery methods, these differ according to the product, Elfeky says. "Some consumers prefer to deal directly with the seller, while others require delivery service, where we currently partner with Ingez for that."<br />
Saboobaa is designed to provide a safe user experience by relying on consumer-protection systems that provide security for personal information and guarantee the rights of the buyer and the seller.<br />
"The website offers a product-rating feature so that consumers would not be cheated. In case of a complaint about a product, the money is immediately returned to the consumer, and the (incident) is viewed as a warning to the seller," Elfeky said. <br />
"The user cannot perform any operation on the site unless he registers, specifically if it's buying or selling." <br />
The Saboobaa site.<br />
Saboobaa is also testing the use of its own in-site parallel currency. The ‘bont’ is the official Saboobaa money, with one bont equaling 10 egyptian pounds ($1.28) and a minimum purchase of five bonts ($6.38).<br />
Bonts are converted to fiat currency through Paypal or by Cason-Delivery. <br />
The payment method is one way to maneuver through the challenges Egypt's ecommerce sector is riddled with: fear of online payment, the scarcity of citizens with bank accounts (about 35 percent of the population) and the high costs of logistics and marketing operations. <br />
Whether entrepreneurship can pave a new path for the Egyptian industry, however, by ecommerce ventures that suit Egyptian consumers’ nature is a question that remains to be answered. <br />

Teaching science to children can be a very challenging job. Not only do you need their full attention, but lessons need to be fun in order for them to assimilate and memorize the information. Gamification is one way to get the message across and this Egyptian entrepreneur is doing it using a solar panel and a toy car. <br />
iSolarWorkx is a do-it-yourself education kit. The car needs some assembly, and a small solar panel on the roof powers a small motor within. By assembling the car and tinkering with the placement of the panel, children can learn how renewable energy works, and hopefully develop an interest in science.<br />
We caught up with iSolarWorkx cofounder Ali Abdel-Hafiz at the 8th annual MIT Enterprise Forum of the Pan Arab Region in Kuwait in April, where he showed us how the car works.<br />

The startup focuses on the personal and emotional interaction between indie artists and their fans by providing tools for musicians to market, share and sell music directly through their fan's social media networks. There is also a gaming aspect to Indiepush, which uses a points system to reward fans for sharing/selling music. <br />

For music fans by musicians<br />
Indiepush was founded by Mahmood Jrere (CEO), Abed Hathut (COO) and Nihad Awidat (CTO), three individuals with strong musical backgrounds. They say it seemed like the perfect time to start the venture, as they themselves could not find a platform where they could easily promote their own music.<br />
Jrere, a musician himself, is a member of Dam – the first Palestinian hip-hop group, founded in 1999. Hatout, from a rock music background, started the rock band Khalas. And Awidat’s background is in electronic music production.<br />
“Indiepush started from passion and love and from a place where musicians could have a platform that was easy to promote themselves and reach a wider crowd,” Jrere says.<br />
Crash course in entrepreneurship<br />
But Indiepush was an idea until the three joined the FastForward Accelerator program. Given the founding team’s background in music, the four month program gave them an introduction to the business of startups, helped them research and develop their business model and introduced the team to the accelerator’s network.<br />
They launched the beta version in January.<br />
While Indiepush is still in beta, the goal is to have a platform that reaches a mainstream audience world wide. But to start, they are focusing on MENA, says Mohamad Ismail, Artists &amp; Repertoire lead.<br />
He notes that they initially wanted to help indie musicians sell their music. But they learned that selling albums is not the primary pain point for artists in MENA. Marketing and promotion are much bigger issues.<br />
“If you’re releasing an album independently without a big record company or distribution company, it’s very difficult to reach an audience,” Jrere says.<br />
“Now we’re focusing on how to help bands really promote their music,” Ismail added. “In order to generate more sales you want to be able to better promote the band, making it easier for the artist to tap into circles beyond his current friends and family. So [you want to be] creating a platform that doesn’t only make selling easier but creating a lot of tools for bands to engage and reward their fans.”<br />
And because they feel that an emphasis on mainstream music has reduced the quality of music overall, they’re working diligently to promote music that they believe in.<br />
Indiepush has recruited almost 70 bands to the platform. They have seen exponential growth with over 1,500 users who visit the site on a monthly basis – with the exception of June, which had nearly 4,000 users. And they say they did this mostly by word of mouth and without spending any money on marketing.<br />
A screenshot of Indiepush's website.<br />
Travel restrictions<br />
Jrere, the CEO, lives in Lod, a predominantly Palestinian city near Tel Aviv in Israel. But most of the others on the team don’t have permits to travel to Israel. So they meet and work in the West Bank city of Ramallah.<br />
But with team members located in Palestine, Israel, Jordan and the US they believe something like Indiepush transcends borders and bureaucracy. The team has daily Skype calls and uses Slack and Twilio to communicate with one another and assign tasks to the team. They say the setup works great for them.<br />
Looking ahead, six months from now, Jrere says, “We will be making progress and our aim is to have 10,000 users per day sign up -- we can do that if we provide the right content and tools for the bands and fans.” They’re also in talks to develop a mobile app so fans can connect with bands on the go.<br />
Since their launch and after completing FastForward, they’ve been trying to get Indiepush to a place where they can seek series A funding. As such, they prefer that the platform grows organically until they reach that point. Hatout, the team’s COO, is currently spending time in the US, forging relationships with the indie music scene there and leading the talks with potential investors.<br />
They’re also tapping into various partnerships and integrating with the offline music scene. They hope to have a presence with music festivals, and eventually plan to sell musician merchandise online and in Jo Bedu stores.<br />
And with crowdfunding platform Zoomaal, they helped facilitate funding for 47SOUL, a new MENA band. 47SOUL seems to be a great model for Indiepush as they listed Indiepush as the recommended retailer for discovering indie artists in the MENA.  <br />
They believe that the fundamental flaw with regards to their competitors however, is the lack of connection between fans and artists.<br />
“You can stream music anywhere but there is very little focus on the relationship between the artist and the fan”, Ismail says. They believe there’s real business in the new economy of music - monetizing that emotional relationship between the fan and the artists.<br />
And it all goes back to their love of music. When asked what their most pressing challenge is, they say popularizing indie music while keeping it indie – they want to redefine what the standard is so that more indie artists are heard on the radio.  <br />
“The world is changing and it’s very easy to put a song out there but the challenge is to get it heard,” Jrere says. “Everyday, good music is being created around us, so we want to be relevant to the youth and to the reality in the region.”<br />
